## Installation :

<p>
These project run on Node.js. On its website you can find instructions on how to install it. You can also follow this gist for a quick and easy way to install Node.js and npm.
</p>

Once installed, clone the repository and install its dependencies running:

```md
$ npm install
```

### Using your own credentials
You will need to register your app and get your own credentials from the [Spotify Api Developers Dashboard]().

To do so, go to your Spotify Api Developers Dashboard and create your application. For the examples, we registered this Redirect URI :

http://localhost:9000 (in my case)

Once you have created your app, replace the client_id, client_secret and redirect_uri (in the edit section) in the example with the ones you get from your Application.

In order to run the project, open the folder, and run the following command : 

```md
$ npm run serve
```

Then, open http://localhost:9000 in a browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
